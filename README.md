# Illumio_TA
Illumio Technical Assessment Code

# Assumptions
The flow logs have consistent data and follow the guidelines listed in the AWS user guide
The 6th field is considered as destination port and 8th field is considered as protocol based on the provided sample flows
All lines in the input log file are valid lines

main.py               -> Main script to run the program <br>
lookup_parser.py      -> Contains function for parsing the lookup table <br>
processor.py          -> Contains functions to process logs and get desired output <br>
protocol_converter.py -> Contains function to convert protocol numbers to names (update file to add more protocols) <br>
output_writer.py      -> Contains function for writing results to CSV files <br>

# Running the Code
## 1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/samhithapentaparthy/Illumio_TA.git
```
## 2. Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed. No additional library dependencies
## 3. Input Files:
Place your flow logs file (logs.txt) and lookup table file (lookup_table.txt) into the data folder <br>
Ensure that lookup_table.csv is in a comma-separated format and logs.txt follows the expected log structure <br> <br>
Note: The sample files provided are present to run code directly <br>
## 4. Run the Code:
```
python main.py
```
## 5. Output:
The results will be saved in the output folder <br><br>
port_protocol_count.csv will contain the counts of port/protocol combinations <br>
tag_count.csv will contain the counts of tags <br>
## 6. Verify:
Open the generated CSV files in a text editor or spreadsheet application to verify the results
